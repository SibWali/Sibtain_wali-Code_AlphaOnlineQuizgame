# Sibtain_wali-Code_AlphaOnlineQuizgame
I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my second task during my internship, where I developed a console-based online quiz game in C++! This project involved several key components, including user registration and login functionality, a series of science-related quiz questions, and a scoring system that provides personalized feedback based on the user's performance. I also implemented features to enhance the user experience, such as hiding passwords during registration and login to ensure security, and providing a detailed breakdown of quiz results. Through this project, I honed my skills in C++ programming, particularly in managing user input, handling data securely, and creating interactive console applications. Achieving these goals has been a rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue exploring and building more complex projects as part of my internship journey.
